# TeenCode

## 🚀 About the Project

TeenCode is an educational platform built by teenagers for teenagers to make learning programming **interactive**, **practical**, and **fun**. Our goal is to help students not just learn code, but **retain and apply** it through real-time coding challenges, practice tasks, and a personalized experience.

We're building a platform that includes:
- 📚 Learn-to-code modules (HTML, CSS, JS, Python, etc.)
- 🧠 Daily coding challenges
- 🏆 Leaderboards and user streaks
- 👨‍💻 An engaging, gamified UI

## 👥 Team Workflow Guidelines

We use **Git**, **GitHub**, and a **branch-based workflow**. Please read carefully before contributing.

## 🔄 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repo** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TeenCode.git
cd TeenCode
```

2. **Create your own branch** to work safely:

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Examples:

• feature/login-page
• feature/leaderboard
• bugfix/responsive-layout

**Making and Saving Changes**
1. Make your changes locally.
2. Save and add your files:

git add .

3. Write a clear commit message:

git commit -m "Added login form with basic validation"

4. Push your branch to GitHub:

git push origin feature/your-feature-name

**Opening a Pull Request (PR)**

After pushing your branch:

• Go to the repository on GitHub.
• You'll see a “Compare & pull request” button – click it.
• Add a title, and explain what you did.
• Submit the PR for review.
• Wait for feedback and merge once approved ✅

**Do NOT Push Directly** to **main**

To keep our project stable:
  • Always work in branches.
  • All changes must go through a Pull Request.
  • At least 1 person must review your PR before merging.

**Best Practices**

• Make small, focused commits
• Use meaningful commit messages
• Pull changes from main before starting new work:

git checkout main
git pull origin main

• Then create a new feature branch from there.
